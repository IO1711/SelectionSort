# SelectionSort
Web application to visually demonstrate the way Selection Sort works

Selection sort finds the smallest number in the list or array and moves that number to the first cell of the list/array. And does this again starting from the second cell of the list/array. Repeats this action until the numbers are completely sorted.

How to use:
Input set of numbers and click sort button. The application starts the demostration.
